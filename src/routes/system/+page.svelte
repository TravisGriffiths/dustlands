   <h1>The EZd6 System</h1>

   <hr>

   The <a href="https://www.ezd6.com/">EZd6 system</a> is played with 1 to 6 six sided dice, written by the amazing DM Scotty
   available from <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?keywords=ezd6&x=0&y=0&author=&artist=&pfrom=&pto=">DriveThru RPG</a> 
   is a minimalist system that has won endless awards and praise from both game reviewers and GMs alike. The system tries to 
   keep all of the fun and stories of common RPGs while cutting the rules to the smallest set possible. The focus is to drive 
   ineresting stories quickly, while making player choices central. 

   <p></p>

   <h2>Core Mechanic</h2>

   Every task has a difficulty, and a target number for that task ranging from Easy (2) to Super Hard (6)
   <ul>
      <li>Easy (2)</li>
      <li>Normal (3)</li>
      <li>Hard (4)</li>
      <li>Very Hard (5)</li>
      <li>Super Hard (6)</li>
   </ul>

   Roll a six sided dice. If you roll the task target number, or higher, your character succeeds. 

   <h2>Core Combat</h2>
   Every opponent has a difficulty to hit just like tasks. For the average enemy, the target number is 3. Characters are normally
   simply a 3 for any opponent to hit. Succeeding on an attack roll will always do a single <a href="#strikes">strike</a> of 
   damage on an opponent no matter what the weapon. <a href="#crital-hits">Critical Hits</a> can do more damage, see below. 

   <h2>Boons</h2>
   When a character is particularly good at doing something, they get a "boon". A boon means you may roll 
   <span class="font-bold">two</span> dice and take the <span class="font-bold">highest</span>. The target number to beat for 
   the task is the same. 

   <h2>Banes</h2>
   When a character is attempting something unusually difficult, for example fighting in total darkness, they will have 
   a "bane". A character with a bane rolls two dice and take the <span class="font-bold">lowest</span>. Banes cancel 
   out boons, resulting in a normal one die roll. 

   <h2>Failure</h2>
   Failure is not all bad. While the character will not succeed at the task, any character failures earns a 
   <a href="#karma">Karma</a> point. Lots of failure, leads to lots of karma which can save a character when 
   they really need it. Karma is explained below. 

   <h2>Critical Failures</h2>
   Rolling a one is a critical failure. It means that not only did a character fail the task, but the GM may apply more secondary 
   difficuties to the situation. Droping a weapon, running out of ammunition, alerting the guards are all examples. 
   <span class="font-bold">Note:</span> the <span class="underline">KEPT</span> die must roll a one. Since a boon is rolling two and keeping the highest, to 
   roll a critical failure while having a boon, means the player has to roll double ones. A skilled character might fail, but 
   is unlikely to really screw up. Likewise a character working under difficult conditions, with a bane, has two chances to roll 
   a critical failure, as either die can be a one, and will be kept.  

   <h2 id="critial-success">Critical Success</h2>
   Similar to critical failures, a 6 is always a success. In combat, hitting an opponent with a critical success does the normal 
   strike of damage, and the player may roll to hit again. On the "confirming" roll, rolling a further six will do another strike, 
   and allow a player to roll again to see if the critical hit continues. There is NO limit on how much damage this can cause. It is 
   also totally possible to use <a href="karma">Karma</a> to "bump" these rolls, allowing massive critical strikes when a players really needs them, if 
   they are willing to spend the resources on them. It is also important to know, that if a critical streak continues to do damage 
   after the first target is defeated, it can continue to strike reachable nearby opponents. 

   <h2 id="karma">Karma</h2>
   Karma is a meta currency that all characters have. A character normally gets 3 karma points at the start of any session. As 
   metioned, any failure earns a character an additional karma point. A karma point can be spent to move a roll by 1 for each 
   karma point spent. If the karma spent turns the roll into a <span class="font-bold">success</span> the karma is spent and 
   the character succeeds in a task. Note that karma cannot mitigate a critical failure unless a player decides to spend enough
   karma to turn the critical failure into a success. The other major use of karma is to keep a critical success roll going in 
   order to create massive damage in a single attack. All karma resets back to 3 each session, and so it a "use or lose" pool.
   Im addition, spending 5 karma can buy a hero die if a player desires. Finally, karma may <span class="font-bold">not</span> 
   be used for Magic, Miracles or any Magic Resistance rolls, these are the manifestation of Chaos, and are immune to mortal karma. 

   <h2>Hero Dice</h2>
   Every character get a single hero die at the start of each session. This can be used to reroll <span class="font-bold">ANY</span>
   roll made by a player, to include those rolls usually excluded from karma manipulation. This is usually kept to reroll critical 
   rolls like final death saves, but a player may use them at any time they wish. 

   <h2>Time</h2>
   Time is measured in 3 units. Narrative time, Action time and Scenes. Narrative time is the flow of time when time is not flowing 
   form moment to moment. It is the normal flow of time during a game session. This may be a few minutes at an Inn or could suddenly
   leap ahead weeks or months. The flow is organic an set by the story, but each player should get input into what is going on. 
   Action time is usually the time used when a party engages in combat, but could also be any time where seconds matter and things 
   are happening very fast. In these cases, player actions go in strict order with each player having an action going around all 
   players. Scenes are called "encounters" in other systems and is just a natural segment of the story. Most effects with a duration
   will map to a scene. Action time usually all falls into a single scene each time it starts and stops. 

   <h2>Actions</h2>
   In Action time, each character gets a <span class="font-bold">move, action</span> and a <span class="font-bold">free action</span>. 
   A move is the ability for a character to move or reposition. Actions are things like an attack, pick up an item, cast a spell or arm a shield. Most things that require a roll are actions. A player may also choose to use actions to do additional 
   movement instead of a normal action if desired. A player may also choose to <span class="font-bold">delay</span> which allows a 
   player to jump in at any point in the round before all players and opponents have acted. This allows players to intterupt opponets 
   so is sometimes desirable. Free actions are quick and simple actions, like speaking (short phrases), taking potions, drawing weapons 
   (as opposed to shields) etc.
