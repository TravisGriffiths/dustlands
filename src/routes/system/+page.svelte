   <h1>The EZd6 System</h1>

   <hr>

   The <a href="https://www.ezd6.com/">EZd6 system</a> is played with 1 to 6 six sided dice, written by the amazing DM Scotty
   available from <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?keywords=ezd6&x=0&y=0&author=&artist=&pfrom=&pto=">DriveThru RPG</a> 
   is a minimalist system that has won endless awards and praise from both game reviewers and GMs alike. The system tries to 
   keep all of the fun and stories of common RPGs while cutting the rules to the smallest set possible. The focus is to drive 
   ineresting stories quickly, while making player choices central.

   <h2>Core Mechanic</h2>

   Every task has a difficulty, and a target number for that task ranging from Easy (2) to Super Hard (6)
   <ul>
      <li>Easy (2)</li>
      <li>Normal (3)</li>
      <li>Hard (4)</li>
      <li>Very Hard (5)</li>
      <li>Super Hard (6)</li>
   </ul>

   Roll a six sided dice. If you roll the task target number, or higher, your character succeeds. 

   <h2>Core Combat</h2>
   Every opponent has a difficulty to hit just like tasks. For the average enemy, the target number is 3. Characters are normally
   simply a 3 for any opponent to hit. Succeeding on an attack roll will always do a single <a href="strikes">strike</a> of 
   damage on an opponent no matter what the weapon. <a href="crital-hits">Critical Hits</a> can do more damage, see below. 

   <h2>Boons</h2>
   When a character is particularly good at doing something, they get a "boon". A boon means you may roll 
   <span class="font-bold">two</span> dice and take the <span class="font-bold">highest</span>. The target number to beat for 
   the task is the same. 

   <h2>Banes</h2>
   When a character is attempting something unusually difficult, for example fighting in total darkness, they will have 
   a "bane". A character with a bane rolls two dice and take the <span class="font-bold">lowest</span>. Banes cancel 
   out boons, resulting in a normal one die roll. 

   <h2>Failure</h2>
   Failure is not all bad. While the character will not succeed at the task, any character failures earns a 
   <a href="#karma">Karma</a> point. Lots of failure, leads to lots of karma which can save a character when 
   they really need it. Karma is explained below. 

   <h2>Critical Failures</h2>
   Rolling a one is a critical failure. It means that not only did a character fail the task, but the GM may apply more secondary 
   difficuties to the situation. Droping a weapon, running out of ammunition, alerting the guards are all examples. 
   <span class="font-bold">Note:</span> the <span class="underline">KEPT</span> die must roll a one. Since a boon is rolling two and keeping the highest, to 
   roll a critical failure while having a boon, means the player has to roll double ones. A skilled character might fail, but 
   is unlikely to really screw up. Likewise a character working under difficult conditions, with a bane, has two chances to roll 
   a critical failure, as either die can be a one, and will be kept.  

   <h2 id="critial-success">Critical Success</h2>
   Similar to critical failures, a 6 is always a success. In combat, hitting an opponent with a critical success does the normal 
   strike of damage, and the player may roll to hit again. On the "confirming" roll, rolling a further six will do another strike, 
   and allow a player to roll again to see if the critical hit continues. There is NO limit on how much damage this can cause. It is 
   also totally possible to use <a href="karma">Karma</a> to "bump" these rolls, allowing massive critical strikes when a players really needs them, if 
   they are willing to spend the resources on them. 

   <h2 id="karma">Karma</h2>
   Karma is a meta currency that all characters have. A character normally gets 3 karma points
