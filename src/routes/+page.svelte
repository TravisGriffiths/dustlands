	<h1>The Dustlands</h1>

	<hr>

	The Dustlands are lands of dry scorching desert on a world, once verdent, now blasted by magical cataclysm. Most of
	the surface is blazing and uninhabitable. Civilization, such that it is, has fled to the poles, where it hangs on in 
	a thousand small villages and tribes scraping a living from the the blasted wilderness.
