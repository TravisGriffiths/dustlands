      <h1 id="grabin">Grabin</h1>
      A once verdant and advanced world of magic and technology rendered to ruins and sand by the great Cataclysm. Civilization clings to the poles where temperatures allow for enough water to allow for some grassland and rain. The equatorial regions are heat baked death zones full of nothing but rock, sand and scorching death...and the treasures of the World that Was.

      <h2>The World That Was</h2>
      The Cataclysm that broke the world happened almost a thousand years ago. Scholars argue about the exact dates and some argue that it was many separate cataclysms rather than a single one. In any event, from the rare wonders and ruins left behind we know that the world was a globe spanning highly magical society with wonders undreamed of in the blasted Age of Dust. There is some evidence that this magical power even allowed the citizens of the ante Cataclysmic world to travel and trade with other worlds and civilizations beyond our current understanding. Sadly, in those times the world was very different and the poles were considered something of an arctic wasteland, with little in the way of population or infrastructure. The great cities of the World that Was are now covered with dust and sand and are mostly atop the highest plateaus. A few madmen claim that the endless seas of sand were once actual seas full of water and that had depths of several miles. This is hard to credit today.


      <h2>The Poles</h2>
      The poles today are sufficiently cool to allow moisture left in the air to rain on the few grasslands left, from which a few great cities of the world today nourish their populations and economies. The seven great cities of the north each have a water source that supports them, and are surrounded by unusually verdant grasslands or biomes that support herds of animals on which the urban populations depend. Some even have what would be recognized as traditional agriculture. The area of the campaign is all around the South Pole. 
      
      <h3>Cosmology</h3>
      At the poles days are called Turns. This is because it is one revolution of Grabin...a day, but being a polar zone, this does not correspond to day and night. Grabin orbits its sun every twelve days. This causes the light and dark cycle break down into four turns of "Night" which are fully dark as the pole is inclined away from the sun. There are four turns of "Day" when the inclination is towards the sun during which temperatures get progressively hotter, becoming unbearable by the end. Between these are "Waning" and "Waxing" which are four turns of shortening and lengthening of the daylight period. Night is never full darkness like here. First there is the Moon, which is very close, very large and moves very quickly across the sky, making 3 full orbits per turn. In addition, Tersus, the night star hangs shining in the night sky, moving around once per turn and giving off a wan white light.

      <h2 id="cities">The Great Cities</h2>
      The largest and most powerful political entities in the South are known as The Great Cities. These are the few places where significant populations, water and food supply has allowed something like a traditional nation states to arise controlling the territory around them for some distance. While these are the largest enties,, they are not the only ones, with many smaller settlements making up baronies and independant small city states. Most people however live in small fortified rural communities and nomadic tribes that sparsely populate the barrens of the South. The Great cities are:

         <li id="galdaur"><b class="mr-2">Gauldaur</b> <i>City of Water, The Canyon Citadel</i> 
            <div>
               Gauldaur is built where an ancient river eroded a thin and deep gash cutting through a high plateau to the valley floor below. Two linked fortresses have been built on both sides of this canyon and the land around quarried out to make an immense dry moat. Meanwhile the magic of the Water Lords fills the depths of the canyons with some of the best source renewable water still found in the Dustlands. The rock quarried out from around the canyon has been turned into both a massive dam at the mouth of the canyon and a truly impressive collection of buildings on the canyon walls.
               The lands surrounding Gauldaur are relatively wet, supporting some of the greenest stands of trees, orchards and grasslands extending many miles from the city itself. The crest of the city is a blue field with the twin fortresses in black upon it.
               Gauldurian culture centers around religion and stands out for excellent social mobility. Marriage is monogamous and inheritence is uniquely by ultimogeniture, inheritence of all property by the youngest.

      <h2>Gods</h2>
      Divine power is fully manifest in the world. Everyone has seen and felt it a few times. It seems the God divide into 5 entities split between 5 facets of divinity. 
      The details of how this works and what various holy men, temples and faiths think of it generally do not much bother most people. 
      However, everyone is religious, in that since the power of the Divine exists, every person has an opinon on how they relate to this power. 

      <h3>The Facets of the Divine</h3>
      Facets are not dieties, but rather domains, interests, or foci of divine power. They are as follows:
      <h4>Life</h4>
      The animating force that fills all living things and makes life possible. 
      <h4>Light</h4>
      The energy of the universe powering life. 
      <h4>Magic</h4>
      The raw flow of magic usually expressed as a movement of energy from Light to Dark, Life to Death. Usually called simply "Flow". 
      <h4>Death</h4>
      The opposite of life, but also what makes it distinct and makes the flow of life possible. It is important to know that what is thought of as "living" is thought to be a process of moving from birth to death. Without Flow, there is only pure Energy and Entropy, nothing can happen.
      <h4>Dark</h4>
      The absence of light, giving it meaning and creating a void that light can flow into creating life and magic. 

      <h3>Dieties</h3>
      What exactly dieties are and how they fit together is the subject of Religion, (see below). There is infinate disagreement about these points.
      What is agreed on and can be confirmed by observation is the existance of the five...entities, for lack of a less controversial term, that are often referred to as Dieties. 

      <h4>Atun</h4>
      <b>Light and Magic</b> - Diety of light and pure energy. Often referred to as "The Source". Given the merciless nature of the full sun, also understood to be something that is essential in part but utterly destructive in over-abundance. 
      <h4>Anubus</h4>
      <b>Magic and Death</b> - Diety of magic and energy towards the entropy of Death, "The Flow". While Atun is the mountain top and the alpine spring of water, Anubis is the valley and pit of endless sand that makes it flow and come alive. 
      <h4>Nergal</h4>
      <b>Death and Dark</b> - Diety of entropy. Often referred to as "The Potential". Not seen as an "evil" force, but just as much of a essential element and enabler of Flow as Atun. 
      <h4>Gia</h4>
      <b>Dark and Life</b> - Diety of Nature and Life, "The Cycle". Gia is a diety of renewal, the force that returns Potential to the Source to start the cycle anew, differently, uniquely, each time. 
      <h4>'Ta</h4>
      <b>Life and Light</b> - Diety of pure Living Energy, "The Beginning". 'Ta starts all life on its journey, again and again. 
      
      <h3>Religions</h3>
      Having grown up in a monothiest culture, we are very glued to the idea of "One God one Religion", which is actually quite a new and culturally specific idea. 
      In Gauldaur, since all the Dieties, or whatever they are, have actual manifestations and effects on the world, "existance" of one diety or other is not especially interesting. 
      What is very much up for debate is the <b>Nature</b> of these Divine forces. The mechanics of <i>How</i> the divine universe functions is called "Maat", and is anything but self evident. 
      Each religion is a sect codifying beliefs on how Maat works, and probably more important, how a proper, successful person should act within this framework. 
      These religions have millenia of bloody history, and very often fight within each other more than against each other. 
      All characters have a religion, essentially an opinon on how they think all of this fits together. How they practice that opinon is entirely up to the player. 
      Looking through these, it should be clear that ideas divergent from the small enumerations here are entirely possible. 
      This is not a complete list of all the religions in existance for this reason. That being said, these are the most common organized faiths. 
      A character with a differing opinion must choose to socially ascribe to a faith (go along with it), or to pursue Heresy. 
      This is not the time of the inquisition. No one is getting burned at the stake, but openly expressing divient beliefs will have social consequenses. 
      This would be like publicly expressing true belief in a Flat Earth or similar. No one is going to lock you up, but there will be degrees of friction and ostracism. 

      <h4>Deism</h4>
      Totally distinct to the real world Diesm, these are religions who understand the Divine Entities to be literal, actual Gods. 
      They are thought to be beings of immense power, but with personalities, wants, desires, and hatreds. 
      Deist sects are probably the oldest religions in the world. Here are the most common:
      <h5>Pentarcy</h5>
      The belief that the Five created, oversee, and actively manage the world. The goal in life is to find excellence and balance at all stages, birth to death. 
      The Gods are equally revered and honored at the appropriate times. This is an old and conservative faith of intracate and ridgid traditions. 
      It is also quite common, particularly among the rich and powerful.
